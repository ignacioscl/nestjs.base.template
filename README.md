## Description

NestJS Project Template
This is a template for a NestJS project, designed to help you get started quickly with building robust and scalable applications using NestJS, a powerful Node.js framework.

## Features
<ul>
<li><b>TypeORM Integration</b>: Easily connect to a MySQL database using TypeORM, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript.</li>

<li><b>Data Access Objects (DAOs)</b>: Implement DAOs to abstract and encapsulate database operations. This provides a clear separation of concerns between data access and business logic.</li>

<li><b>Services</b>: Define services to encapsulate and manage the business logic of your application. Services can be injected into controllers and other components.</li>

<li><b>Filters</b>: Implement filters to handle exceptions and customize the error responses returned by the API.</li>

<li><b>Response Containers</b>: Use response containers to standardize API responses and provide consistent data structures for success and error responses.</li>

<li><b>Entities</b>: Define TypeORM entities to model your database tables and relationships. Entities represent the structure of your data.</li>

<li><b>Controllers</b>: Create controllers to handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate service methods. Controllers define the API endpoints.</li>

<li><b>Dotenv Configuration</b>: Manage configuration settings using dotenv, a module for loading environment variables from a .env file.</li>


## Usage
This template provides a solid foundation for building NestJS applications. You can extend it by adding your own controllers, services, and entities to suit your project's requirements.
